# Email Phishing Simulation Platform

A web-based platform designed to simulate phishing attacks in a safe and controlled environment. The goal is to raise awareness and educate users on recognizing and avoiding phishing attempts.

## Overview

This tool allows an **admin** to launch simulated phishing campaigns using customizable email templates. Dummy users receive these emails, interact with them, and their actions are tracked, including email opens, link clicks, and form submissions. After interaction, users are redirected to an educational page that explains phishing indicators and provides preventive tips.
